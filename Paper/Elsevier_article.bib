abstract = {A redox flow battery using Fe 2+/Fe 3+ and V 2+/V 3+ redox couples in chloric/sulfuric mixed-acid supporting electrolyte is investigated for potential stationary energy storage applications. The Fe/V redox flow cell using mixed reactant solutions operates within a voltage window of 0.5-1.35 V with a nearly 100{\%} utilization ratio and demonstrates stable cycling over 100 cycles with energy efficiency {\textgreater} 80{\%} and no capacity fading at room temperature. A 25{\%} improvement in the discharge energy density of the Fe/V cell is achieved compared with a previously reported Fe/V cell using a pure chloride acid supporting electrolyte. Stable performance is achieved in the temperature range between 0 and 50 °C as well as when using a microporous separator as the membrane. The improved electrochemical performance makes the Fe/V redox flow battery a promising option as a stationary energy storage device to enable renewable integration and stabilization of the electric grid. {\textcopyright} 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH {\&} Co.

  abstract = {Redox flow batteries (RFBs) are one of the most promising scalable electricity-storage systems to address the intermittency issues of renew-able energy sources such as wind and solar. The prerequisite for RFBs to be economically viable and widely employed is their low cost. Here we present a new zinc–iron (Zn–Fe) RFB based on double-membrane triple-electrolyte design that is estimated to have under {\$}100 per kW h system capital cost. Such a low cost is achieved by a combination of inexpensive redox materials (i.e., zinc and iron) and high cell performance (e.g., 676 mW cm {\`{A}}2 power density). Engineering of the cell structure is found to be critical to enable the high power density. Our cost model shows that a Zn–Fe RFB demonstrates the lowest cost among some notable RFBs and could reach the 2023 cost target set by the U.S. Department of Energy ({\$}150 per kW h). The widespread deployment of renewable energies such as wind and solar calls for energy-storage systems to smooth out their intermittent electricity generation. Various technologies have been introduced, including physical methods such as pumped hydro and compressed air, and electrochemical methods such as regenerative fuel cells and rechargeable batteries. 1–7 Redox flow batteries (RFBs) are one of the most promising systems due to their excellent scalability. Freeing the redox pairs from the solid electrodes into flowing electrolytes allows independent engineering for energy (through electrolytes) and power (through electrodes), leading to flexibility in system design and deployment. 8–12 One of the prerequisites for RFBs to be widely employed in energy storage is their low capital cost. To make electricity-storage systems economically viable, the US Department of Energy has set a system capital cost target of {\$}150 per kW h by 2023, 13 and an even lower target of {\$}100 per kW h is needed to match the existing grid-level storage technologies of pumped hydro and compressed air. However, these targets have not been met so far due to the high cost of redox pairs and/or the low power density of cells. For example, the most developed all-vanadium (denoted as all-V) RFBs currently have a system capital cost around B{\$}300–{\$}800 per kW h. 14 Here we design a new RFB that uses low-cost redox pairs (i.e., zinc and iron, denoted as a Zn–Fe RFB) and demonstrates high power density (e.g., 676 mW cm},

abstract = {Wind power generation studies of slow phenomena using a detailed model can be difficult to perform with a conventional offline simulation program. Due to the computational power and high-speed input and output, a real-time simulator is capable of conducting repetitive simulations of wind profiles in a short time with detailed models of critical components and allows testing of prototype controllers through hardware-in-the-loop (HIL). This paper discusses methods to overcome the challenges of real-time simulation of wind systems, characterized by their complexity and high-frequency switching. A hybrid flow-battery supercapacitor energy storage system (ESS), coupled in a wind turbine generator to smooth wind power, is studied by real-time HIL simulation. The prototype controller is embedded in one real-time simulator, while the rest of the system is implemented in another independent simulator. The simulation results of the detailed wind system model show that the hybrid ESS has a lower battery cost, higher battery longevity, and improved overall efficiency over its reference ESS.

abstract = {Storage technologies and storage integration are currently key topics of research in energy systems, due to the resulting possibilities for reducing the costs of renewables integration. Off-grid power systems in particular have received wide attention around the world, as they allow electricity access in remote rural areas at lower costs than grid extension. They are usually integrated with storage units, especially batteries. A key issue in cost effectiveness of such systems is battery degradation as the battery is charged and discharged. We present linear programming models for the optimal management of off-grid systems. The main contribution of this study is developing a methodology to include battery degradation processes inside the optimization models, through the definition of battery degradation costs. As there are very limited data that can be used to relate the battery usage with degradation issues, we propose sensitivity analyses to investigate how degradation costs and different operational patterns relate each others. The objective is to show the combinations of battery costs and performance that makes the system more economic.},

abstract = {This paper presents a detailed analysis of the levelized cost of storage (LCOS) for different electricity storage technologies. Costs were analyzed for a long-term storage system (100 MW power and 70 GWh capacity) and a short-term storage system (100 MW power and 400 MWh capacity). Detailed data sets for the latest costs of four technology groups are provided in this paper. The LCOS method allows a cost comparison of technologies in different system designs and various operation modes. The results for the long-term storage show that Pumped-Storage Hydroelectricity has the lowest LCOS among the mature technologies today. Power to Gas technologies, once established on the market, may also provide long-term electricity storage at even lower LCOS. Pumped-Storage Hydroelectricity is also the cheapest technology for short-term storage systems. Battery systems at the moment still have high costs but are expected to have a sharp price decrease in the near future. Power to Gas and adiabatic Compressed Air Energy Storage systems may become cost competitive as short-term storage systems as well. The detailed analysis of the cost components shows that the cost composition is very inhomogeneous among the technologies. Plant design optimized to the application is therefore crucial for cost minimization. Sensitivity analysis shows that for most technologies the amount of energy discharged as well as the cost of electricity purchase are the most influential factors for the LCOS.},

abstract = {Low-cost energy storage systems are required to support extensive deployment of intermittent renewable energy on the electricity grid. Redox flow batteries have potential advantages to meet the stringent cost target for grid applications as compared to more traditional batteries based on an enclosed architecture. However, the manufacturing process and therefore potential high-volume production price of redox flow batteries is largely unquantified. We present a comprehensive assessment of a prospective production process for aqueous all vanadium flow battery and nonaqueous lithium polysulfide flow battery. The estimated investment and variable costs are translated to fixed expenses, profit, and warranty as a function of production volume. When compared to lithium-ion batteries, redox flow batteries are estimated to exhibit lower costs of manufacture, here calculated as the unit price less materials costs, owing to their simpler reactor (cell) design, lower required area, and thus simpler manufacturing process. Redox flow batteries are also projected to achieve the majority of manufacturing scale benefits at lower production volumes as compared to lithium-ion. However, this advantage is offset due to the dramatically lower present production volume of flow batteries compared to competitive technologies such as lithium-ion.},

To stabilise the highly supersaturated vanadium solutions, several additives were evaluated as possible stabilizing agents for the thermal precipitation of supersaturated V(V) solutions at elevated temperatures. The Blank 3 M V(V) solution in a sulfuric acid supporting electrolyte containing 5 M total sulfates, showed thermal precipitation after 3 days, while the solution containing 1 wt{\%} H3PO4 additive increased the induction time for precipitation to over 47 days at 30°C.

The cell was subjected to 90 charge-discharge cycles and no precipitation or capacity loss was observed in the presence of 1wt{\%} H3PO4 + 2 wt{\%} ammonium sulfate.

System complexity, e.g. the combination of hydraulic and electric circuits requires a multi-physic modeling approach to cover all dependencies between subsystems. A Matlab/Simulink model is introduced, which covers a variable number of stacks and their hydraulic circuit, as well as the impact of shunt currents. Using analytic approaches that are afterward crosschecked with the developed model, a six-stack, 54 kW/216 kWh system is designed. With the simulation results it is demonstrated how combining stacks to strings and varying pipe diameters affects system efficiency. As cell voltage is comparatively low, connecting stacks in series to strings seems reasonable to facilitate grid connection. It is shown that this significantly lowers system efficiency. Hydraulic circuit design is varied to lower efficiency drop. In total, four different electric designs are equipped with 21 hydraulic design variations to quantify dependencies between electric and hydraulic subsystems. Furthermore, it is examined whether additional shunt current losses through stack series connection can be compensated by more efficient energy conversion systems.},

abstract = {The total energy storage system cost is determined by means of a robust performance-based cost model for multiple flow battery chemistries. Systems aspects such as shunt current losses, pumping losses and various flow patterns through electrodes are accounted for. The system cost minimizing objective function determines stack design by optimizing the state of charge operating range, along with current density and current-normalized flow. The model cost estimates are validated using 2-kW stack performance data for the same size electrodes and operating conditions. Using our validated tool, it has been demonstrated that an optimized all-vanadium system has an estimated system cost of {\textless} {\$}350 kWh{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} for 4-h application. With an anticipated decrease in component costs facilitated by economies of scale from larger production volumes, coupled with performance improvements enabled by technology development, the system cost is expected to decrease to 160 kWh{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} for a 4-h application, and to {\$}100 kWh{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} for a 10-h application. This tool has been shared with the redox flow battery community to enable cost estimation using their stack data and guide future direction.},

abstract = {Conventional vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs) using Nafion 115 suffered from issues associated with high ohmic resistance and high capital cost. In this work, we report a commercial membrane (VANADion), consisting of a porous layer and a dense Nafion layer, as a promising alternative to Nafion 115. In the dual-layer structure, the porous layer (∼210 $\mu$m) can offer a high ionic conductivity and the dense Nafion layer (∼20 $\mu$m) can depress the convective flow of electrolyte through the membrane. By comparing with the conventional Nafion 115 in a VRFB, it is found that the change from the conventional Nafion 115 to the composite one results in an increase in the energy efficiency from 71.3{\%} to 76.2{\%} and an increase in the electrolyte utilization from 54.1{\%} to 68.4{\%} at a current density of as high as 240 mA cm−2. In addition, although two batteries show the comparable cycling performance at current densities ranging from 80 mA cm−2 to 240 mA cm−2, the composite membrane is estimated to be significantly cheaper than the conventional Nafion 115 due to the fact that the porous layer is rather cost-effective and the dense Nafion layer is rather thin. The impressive combination of desirable performance and low cost makes this composite membrane highly promising in the VRFB applications.},

abstract = {Redox flow batteries show promise for grid-scale energy storage applications but are presently too expensive for widespread adoption. Electrolyte material costs constitute a sizeable fraction of the redox flow battery price. As such, this work develops a techno-economic model for redox flow batteries that accounts for redox-active material, salt, and solvent contributions to the electrolyte cost. Benchmark values for electrolyte constituent costs guide identification of design constraints. Nonaqueous battery design is sensitive to all electrolyte component costs, cell voltage, and area-specific resistance. Design challenges for nonaqueous batteries include minimizing salt content and dropping redox-active species concentration requirements. Aqueous battery design is sensitive to only redox-active material cost and cell voltage, due to low area-specific resistance and supporting electrolyte costs. Increasing cell voltage and decreasing redox-active material cost present major materials selection challenges for aqueous batteries. This work minimizes cost-constraining variables by mapping the battery design space with the techno-economic model, through which we highlight pathways towards low price and moderate concentration. Furthermore, the techno-economic model calculates quantitative iterations of battery designs to achieve the Department of Energy battery price target of {\$}100 per kWh and highlights cost cutting strategies to drive battery prices down further.},

This is supplemented with a shunt current model and a pumping loss model to estimate actual system efficiency. The operating parameters such as power density, flow rates and design parameters such as electrode aspect ratio and flow frame channel dimensions are adjusted to maximize efficiency and minimize capital costs. Detailed cost estimates are obtained from various vendors to calculate cost estimates for present, near-term and optimistic scenarios. The most cost-effective chemistries with optimum operating conditions for power or energy intensive applications are determined, providing a roadmap for battery management systems development for redox flow batteries. The main drivers for cost reduction for various chemistries are identified as a function of the energy to power ratio of the storage system.

The chloride solutions were capable of dissolving more than 2.3 M vanadium at varied valence states and remained stable at 0-50 °C. The improved stability appeared due to the formation of a vanadium dinuclear [V(2)O(3){\textperiodcentered}4H(2)O](4+) or a dinuclear-chloro complex [V(2)O(3)Cl{\textperiodcentered}3H(2)O](3+) in the solutions over a wide temperature range. The all-vanadium redox flow batteries with the chloride electrolytes demonstrated excellent reversibility and fairly high efficiencies. Only negligible, if any, gas evolution was observed. The improved energy capacity and good performance, along with the ease in heat management, would lead to substantial reduction in capital cost and life-cycle cost, making the vanadium chloride redox flow battery a promising candidate for stationary applications.},

  abstract      = {A zeolite-water adsorption module, which has been originally constructed for an adsorption heat pump, has been experimentally investigated as an adsorptive thermal energy storage unit. The adsorber/desorber heat exchanger contains 13.2 kg of zeolite 13X and is connected to an evaporator/condenser heat exchanger via a butterfly valve. The flow rate of the heat transfer fluid in the adsorber/desorber unit has been changed between 0.5 and 2.0 l min?1, the inlet temperature to the evaporator between 10 and 408C. It turned out that the higher the flow rate inside the adsorber/desorber unit the faster and more effective is the discharge of heat. However, at lower flow rates higher discharge temperatures are obtained. Storage capacities of 2.7 and 3.1kWh have been measured at the evaporator inlet temperatures of 10 and 408C, respectively, corresponding to thermal energy storage densities of 80 and 92kWhm?3 based on the volume of the adsorber unit. The measured maximum power density increases from 144 to 165kWhm?3 as the flow rate in the adsorber increases from 0.5 to 2 l min?1. An internal insulation in form of a radiation shield around the adsorber heat exchanger is recommended to reduce the thermal losses of the adsorptive storage. Copyright},

To address the issue of system complexity and irreversible losses, we have undertaken a detailed analysis of the concept of the symmetric redox flow battery, or SRFB, which relies on a single parent molecule as the charge storage species in both the positive and negative electrode reactions. Herein we elaborate on the operating principles and advantages of a SRFB and report the salient electrochemical properties of a class of organic molecules, diaminoanthraquinones (DAAQs) as promising candidates for use in SRFB redox electrolytes. Modeling of various modes of operation for SRFBs are presented along with an example of an operational, lab-scale SRFB based on a DAAQ system.},

abstract = {As the fraction of electricity generation from intermittent renewable sources--such as solar or wind--grows, the ability to store large amounts of electrical energy is of increasing importance. Solid-electrode batteries maintain discharge at peak power for far too short a time to fully regulate wind or solar power output. In contrast, flow batteries can independently scale the power (electrode area) and energy (arbitrarily large storage volume) components of the system by maintaining all of the electro-active species in fluid form. Wide-scale utilization of flow batteries is, however, limited by the abundance and cost of these materials, particularly those using redox-active metals and precious-metal electrocatalysts. Here we describe a class of energy storage materials that exploits the favourable chemical and electrochemical properties of a family of molecules known as quinones. The example we demonstrate is a metal-free flow battery based on the redox chemistry of 9,10-anthraquinone-2,7-disulphonic acid (AQDS). AQDS undergoes extremely rapid and reversible two-electron two-proton reduction on a glassy carbon electrode in sulphuric acid. An aqueous flow battery with inexpensive carbon electrodes, combining the quinone/hydroquinone couple with the Br2/Br(-) redox couple, yields a peak galvanic power density exceeding 0.6 W cm(-2) at 1.3 A cm(-2). Cycling of this quinone-bromide flow battery showed {\textgreater}99 per cent storage capacity retention per cycle. The organic anthraquinone species can be synthesized from inexpensive commodity chemicals. This organic approach permits tuning of important properties such as the reduction potential and solubility by adding functional groups: for example, we demonstrate that the addition of two hydroxy groups to AQDS increases the open circuit potential of the cell by 11{\%} and we describe a pathway for further increases in cell voltage. The use of $\pi$-aromatic redox-active organic molecules instead of redox-active metals represents a new and promising direction for realizing massive electrical energy storage at greatly reduced cost.},

abstract = {Large-scale energy storage represents a key challenge for renewable energy and new systems with low cost, high energy density and long cycle life are desired. In this article, we develop a new lithium/polysulfide (Li/PS) semi-liquid battery for large-scale energy storage, with lithium polysulfide (Li2S8) in ether solvent as a catholyte and metallic lithium as an anode. Unlike previous work on Li/S batteries with discharge products such as solid state Li2S2 and Li2S, the catholyte is designed to cycle only in the range between sulfur and Li2S4. Consequently all detrimental effects due to the formation and volume expansion of solid Li2S2/Li2S are avoided. This novel strategy results in excellent cycle life and compatibility with flow battery design. The proof-of-concept Li/PS battery could reach a high energy density of 170 W h kg−1 and 190 W h L−1 for large scale storage at the solubility limit, while keeping the advantages of hybrid flow batteries. We demonstrated that, with a 5 M Li2S8 catholyte, energy densities of 97 W h kg−1 and 108 W h L−1 can be achieved. As the lithium surface is well passivated by LiNO3 additive in ether solvent, internal shuttle effect is largely eliminated and thus excellent performance over 2000 cycles is achieved with a constant capacity of 200 mA h g−1. This new system can operate without the expensive ion-selective membrane, and it is attractive for large-scale energy storage.},

Here we show electrolyte transport limits the utilization of the positive electrode at critical C-rates during discharge; whereas, a combination of electrolyte transport and polarization lead to lithium plating in the graphite electrode during charge. Experimental measurements are compared with theoretical predictions based on concentrated solution and porous electrode theories. An analytical expression is derived to provide design criteria for long lived operation based on the physical properties of the electrode and electrolyte. Finally, a guideline is proposed that graphite cells should avoid charge current densities near or above 4 mA/cm2 unless additional precautions have been made to avoid deleterious side reaction.},

However, one challenge in designing a microgrid system is specifying the size of the ESS. This selection is made more complex due to the independent power and energy ratings inherent in VRB systems. Sizing a VRB for both required power output and energy storage capacity requires an in-depth analysis to produce both optimal scheduling capabilities and minimum capital costs. This paper presents an analytical method to determine the optimal ratings of VRB energy storage based on an optimal scheduling analysis and cost-benefit analysis for microgrid applications. A dynamic programming (DP) algorithm is used to solve the optimal scheduling problem considering the efficiency and operating characteristics of the VRBs. The proposed method has been applied to determine the optimal VRB power and energy ratings for both isolated and grid-connected microgrids, which contain PV arrays and fossil-fuel-based generation. We first consider the case in which a grid-tie is not available and diesel generation is the backup source of power. The method is then extended to consider the case in which a utility grid tie is available.},

abstract = {Wind power is characterized as intermittent with stochastic fluctuations, which can result in deviation of grid frequency and voltage when the wind power ratio is high enough. These effects have a definite impact on stability and power quality of grid operation. This paper proposes an energy storage system (ESS) based power control for a grid-connected wind power system to improve power quality and stability of the power system. Vanadium redox flow battery (VRB), as an environmentally-friendly battery provided with many advantages, is employed in the ESS. A dynamic mathematical model of VRB is built by using an equivalent circuit, and its charging and discharging characteristics are analyzed. The VRB's stable voltage is available in a wide range (around 20-80{\%} state of charge), which is suitable for utilization of a single-stage AC/DC converter in the VRB-based ESS. With a proposed energy storage control method, VRB-based ESS is added at the exit of the grid-connected wind farm to filter fluctuations of wind power, which ensures that smooth power will be injected into the grid and which improves power quality of the power system. Simulations and experiments are carried out to verify the proposed power control method for these grid-connected wind power systems. The grid-connected wind farm with VRB-based ESS, wind speed (characterized as gust and stochastic wind), and wind turbines are modeled in simulations. Simulation results show that the grid-injected active power from the wind farm is effectively smoothed, and reactive power support can be provided for the grid by the designed VRB-based ESS. Experimental verification is achieved with a low power bench, where a RT-LAB real-time simulation platform and a direct torque controlled induction motor simulate a real wind turbine and a wind speed model is built in the RT-LAB real-time simulation platform. The experimental results verify the proposed scheme through demonstrating a stable and smooth power flow injected into the grid though the wind power fluctuated. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Energy storage may serve as a solution to the integration challenges of high penetrations of wind, helping to reduce curtailment, provide system balancing services, and reduce emissions. This study determines the minimum cost configuration of vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFB), wind turbines, and natural gas reciprocating engines in an off-grid model. A life cycle assessment (LCA) model is developed to determine the system configuration needed to achieve a variety of CO2-eq emissions targets. The relationship between total system costs and life cycle emissions are used to optimize the generation mixes to achieve emissions targets at the least cost and determine when VRFBs are preferable over wind curtailment. Different greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions targets are defined for the off-grid system and the minimum cost resource configuration is determined to meet those targets. This approach determines when the use of VRFBs is more cost effective than wind curtailment in reaching GHG emissions targets. The research demonstrates that while incorporating energy storage consistently reduces life cycle carbon emissions, it is not cost effective to reduce curtailment except under very low emission targets (190g of CO2-eq/kWh and less for the examined system). This suggests that "overbuilding" wind is a more viable option to reduce life cycle emissions for all but the most ambitious carbon mitigation targets. The findings show that adding VRFB as energy storage could be economically preferable only when wind curtailment exceeds 66{\%} for the examined system. The results were most sensitive to VRFB costs, natural gas upstream emissions (e.g. methane leakage), and wind capital cost.},

We investigate electrochemical systems capable of economically storing energy for hours and present an analysis of the relationships among technological performance characteristics, component cost factors, and system price for established and conceptual aqueous and nonaqueous batteries. We identified potential advantages of nonaqueous flow batteries over those based on aqueous electrolytes; however, new challenging constraints burden the nonaqueous approach, including the solubility of the active material in the electrolyte. Requirements in harmony with economically effective energy storage are derived for aqueous and nonaqueous systems. The attributes of flow batteries are compared to those of aqueous and nonaqueous enclosed and hybrid (semi-flow) batteries. Flow batteries are a promising technology for reaching these challenging energy storage targets owing to their independent power and energy scaling, reliance on facile and reversible reactants, and potentially simpler manufacture as compared to established enclosed batteries such as lead–acid or lithium-ion.},

abstract = {The variable output of a large wind farm presents many integration challenges, especially at high levels of penetration. The uncertainty in the output of a large wind plant can be covered by using fast-acting dispatchable sources, such as natural gas turbines or hydro generators. However, using dispatchable sources on short notice to smooth the variability of wind power can increase the cost of large-scale wind power integration. To remedy this, the inclusion of large-scale energy storage at the wind farm output can be used to improve the predictability of wind power and reduce the need for load following and regulation hydro or fossil-fuel reserve generation. This paper presents sizing and control methodologies for a zincbromine flow battery-based energy storage system. The results show that the power flow control strategy does have a significant impact on proper sizing of the rated power and energy of the system. In particular, artificial neural network control strategies resulted in significantly lower cost energy storage systems than simplified controllers. The results show that through more effective control and coordination of energy storage systems, the predictability of wind plant outputs can be increased and the cost of integration associated with reserve requirements can be decreased. {\textcopyright} 2010 IEEE.},

abstract = {We measure the polarization characteristics of a quinone-bromide redox flow battery with interdigitated flow fields, using electro-chemical impedance spectroscopy and voltammetry of a full cell and of a half cell against a reference electrode. We find linear polarization behavior at 50{\%} state of charge all the way to the short-circuit current density of 2.5 A/cm 2 . We uniquely identify the polarization area-specific resistance (ASR) of each electrode, the membrane ASR to ionic current, and the electronic contact ASR. We use voltage probes to deduce the electronic current density through each sheet of carbon paper in the quinone-bearing electrode. By interpreting the results using the Newman 1-D porous electrode model, we deduce the volumetric exchange current density of the porous electrode. We uniquely evaluate the power dissipation and identify a correspondence to the contributions to the electrode ASR from the faradaic, electronic, and ionic transport processes. We find that, within the electrode, more power is dissipated in the faradaic process than in the electronic and ionic conduction processes combined, despite the observed linear polarization behavior. We examine the sensitivity of the ASR to the values of the model parameters. The greatest performance improvement is anticipated from increasing the volumetric exchange current density. The intermittency of wind and solar energy is motivating research on cost-effective large-scale electrical energy storage. Redox flow batteries are regarded as promising solutions as they possess many desirable attributes, including independent scaling of power and en-ergy, long cycle life, and excellent safety. 1 The most commercially advanced RFB chemistry employs vanadium ions, whose high perfor-mance has led to MWh-scale developments. The rarity of vanadium and its variable price, however, is spurring the pursuit of alternative RFB chemistries. Among them, organic molecules such as quinones in aqueous solution are especially promising as they contain only in-expensive, earth-abundant elements and have properties that may be tuned for RFB applications. In both acidic and alkaline aqueous me-dia, quinone-based RFBs have achieved power densities comparable to those of vanadium RFBs. 2–4},

abstract = {For storage of grid-scale electrical energy, redox-flow batteries (RFBs) are considered promising technologies. This paper explores the influence of electrolyte composition and ion transport on cell performance by using an integrated approach of experiments and cost modeling. In particular, the impact of the area-specific resistance on system capability is elucidated for the hydrogen/bromine RFB. The experimental data demonstrate very good performance with 1.46 W cm−2 peak power and 4 A cm−2 limiting current density at ambient conditions for an optimal cell design and reactant concentrations. The data and cost model results show that higher concentrations of RFB reactants do not necessarily result in lower capital cost as there is a tradeoff between cell performance and storage (tank) requirements. In addition, the discharge time and overall efficiency demonstrate nonlinear effects on system cost, with a 3 to 4 hour minimum discharge time showing a key transition to a plateau in terms of cost for typical RFB systems. The presented results are applicable to many different RFB chemistries and technologies and highlight the importance of ohmic effects and associated area-specific resistance on RFB viability.},

  abstract  = {This paper proposes a methodology for the economic optimisation of the sizing of Energy Storage Systems (ESSs) whilst enhancing the participation of Wind Power Plants (WPP) in network primary frequency control support. The methodology was designed flexibly, so it can be applied to different energy markets and to include different ESS technologies. The methodology includes the formulation and solving of a Linear Programming (LP) problem.The methodology was applied to the particular case of a 50. MW WPP, equipped with a Vanadium Redox Flow battery (VRB) in the UK energy market. Analysis is performed considering real data on the UK regular energy market and the UK frequency response market. Data for wind power generation and energy storage costs are estimated from literature.Results suggest that, under certain assumptions, ESSs can be profitable for the operator of a WPP that is providing frequency response. The ESS provides power reserves such that the WPP can generate close to the maximum energy available. The solution of the optimisation problem establishes that an ESS with a power rating of 5.3. MW and energy capacity of about 3. MW. h would be enough to provide such service whilst maximising the incomes for the WPP operator considering the regular and frequency regulation UK markets.},

In this paper, a stack-level model based on the circuit analog method is proposed to research the shunt current loss of the vanadium redox flow battery, in which the SOC (state of charge) of electrolyte is introduced. The distribution of shunt current is described in detail. The sensitive analysis of shunt current is reported. The shunt current loss in charge/discharge cycle is predicted with the given experimental data. The effect of charge/discharge pattern on the shunt current loss is studied. The result shows that the reduction of the number of single cells in series, the decrease of the resistances of manifold and channel and the increase of the power of single cell will be the further development for the VRFB stack. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract  = {The increased number of renewable power plants pose threat to power system balance. Their intermittent nature makes it very difficult to predict power output, thus either additional reserve power plants or new storage and control technologies are required. Traditional spinning reserve cannot fully compensate sudden changes in renewable energy power generation. Using new storage technologies such as flow batteries, it is feasible to balance the variations in power and voltage within very short period of time. This paper summarises the controlled use of hybrid flow battery, thermal and hydro power plant system, to support wind power plants to reach near perfect balance, i.e. make the total power output as close as possible to the predicted value. It also investigates the possibility of such technology to take part in the balance of the Lithuanian power system. A dynamic model of flow battery is demonstrated where it evaluates the main parameters such as power, energy, reaction time and efficiency. The required battery size is tested based on range of thermal and hydro power plant reaction times. This work suggests that power and energy of a reasonable size flow battery is sufficient to correct the load and wind power imbalance.},

This paper presents an optimal operation strategy for a battery energy storage system (BESS) in relation to the real-time electricity price in order to achieve the maximum profits of the BESS. The western Danish power system, which is currently the grid area in the world that has the largest share of wind power in its generation profiles and may represent the future of electricity markets in some ways, is chosen as the studied power system in this paper. Two kinds of BESS, based on polysulfide-bromine (PSB) and vanadium redox (VRB) battery technologies, are studies in the paper. Simulation results show, that the proposed optimal operation strategy is an effective measure to achieve maximum profits of the BESS. The results also show that it will take longer time to return the original investment of the VRB battery. So the PSB battery is the better investment choice for the time being.},

Unfortunately, practical implementation has been hampered by various cost and performance issues typical of an immature state of development. One critical factor for the competitiveness of this technology is the installed cost. In this work, we incorporate recent developments in all-vanadium RFBs research and present an analysis of the associated cost factors. The major components of a RFB that affect installed cost are identified and used as variables to create a capital cost function. The function is then used to calculate the rate of change of the capital costs with respect to the major components. The capital costs are also calculated for a range of component values and plotted. Key findings include a high sensitivity of system capital cost to purity of vanadium and substantial fractions of the cost associated with perflurorosulfonic acid membranes currently used for proton transport.},

  abstract  = {The decarbonisation of electricity networks has led to increasing numbers of renewables in the energy mix. Besides energy generation, large-scale wind generators are now called to provide mandatory frequency response according to several grid regulations. This, however, could impose significant constraints on their operation, reducing the capabilities in power and energy delivery and resulting in loss of profits. Energy storage systems (ESSs) can act as a means to limit these losses and ensure that services are delivered according to network regulations. However, there are many occasions where a single energy storage (ES) technology would fail to be economically viable for this purpose. This paper builds on established techniques for sizing ES to complement wind generators in providing frequency support and introduces considerations for hybrid ES systems (HESSs) comprised of more than one technology. The methodology was applied for a 60 MW wind farm complemented by a Vanadium Redox flow battery (VRFB) and supercapacitors for the provision of Primary, Secondary and High frequency response as defined in United Kingdom (UK) Grid Code, however it is technology-independent and could be used to support various cases. Linear Programming is used for sizing the system and maximizing revenues and three cases are compared i.e. using no storage, using a single ESS and using a HESS respectively. The results confirm that, under certain conditions, the use of a HESS can provide increased revenues for this type of applications. {\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.},

Battery storage could increase its profitability by providing fast regulation service under a performance-based regulation mechanism, which better exploits a battery's fast ramping capability. However, battery life might be decreased by frequent charge-discharge cycling, especially when providing fast regulation service. It is profitable for battery storage to extend its service life by limiting its operational strategy to some degree. Thus, we incorporate a battery cycle life model into a profit maximization model to determine the optimal bids in day-ahead energy, spinning reserve, and regulation markets. Then a decomposed online calculation method to compute cycle life under different operational strategies is proposed to reduce the complexity of the model. This novel bidding model would help investor-owned battery storages better decide their bidding and operational schedules and investors to estimate the battery storage's economic viability. The validity of the proposed model is proven by case study results.},

This paper investigates the combined optimization of a wind farm and a pumped-storage facility from the point of view of a generation company in a market environment. The optimization model is formulated as a two-stage stochastic programming problem with two random parameters: market prices and wind generation. The optimal bids for the day-ahead spot market are the ldquohere and nowrdquo decisions while the optimal operation of the facilities are the recourse variables. A joint configuration is modeled and compared with an uncoordinated operation. A realistic example case is presented where the developed models are tested with satisfactory results.},

The unit commitment problem with spinning reserve for MG is considered in this new method. The total cost function, which includes the cost of ESS, cost of output power and cost of spinning reserve, is introduced. The effectiveness of the approach is validated by a case study where the optimal ESS rating for MG is determined. The quantitative results show that the ESS with an optimal size is not only storing renewable energy and re-dispatching it appropriately, but also saving the the total cost for MG. The main method is formulated as a mixed nonlinear integer problem (MNIP), which is solved in AMPL (A Modeling Language for Mathematical Programming).},

  abstract  = {In future electricity systems with a high share of intermittent renewable power generation, battery technologies have the potential to support power quality and security. The growing scientific literature on batteries reflects the high attention that currently rests on these technologies. This paper reviews the existing literature on lifecycle costs of batteries in stationary applications. The primary result of this review is that, despite the current high degree of variance in technological and economic battery data, a systematic assessment of the underlying uncertainty is lacking. The present paper addresses this disparity with an investigation of the impact of uncertainty in input parameters on lifecycle costs of four battery technologies across six electricity system applications. Based on input data collected from literature and via expert interviews, a probabilistic techno-economic model was built that calculates lifecycle costs and systematically addresses uncertainty in input parameters by applying a Monte Carlo simulation. The main conclusion of this paper is that the present uncertainty in cost and technical parameters of batteries exceeds by far the differences in lifecycle costs across technologies. For most electricity storage applications, the absolute differences in mean lifecycle costs across technologies are negligible compared to the uncertainty ranges of the mean lifecycle costs. Therefore, a competition still exists between the four analyzed battery technologies and so far a leading technology has yet to emerge in any of the investigated applications. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The text illustrates the breadth of the modeling and analysis capabilities that are supported by the software and support of complex real-world applications. Pyomo is an open source software package for formulating and solving large-scale optimization and operations research problems. The text begins with a tutorial on simple linear and integer programming models. A detailed reference of Pyomo's modeling components is illustrated with extensive examples, including a discussion of how to load data from data sources like spreadsheets and databases. Chapters describing advanced modeling capabilities for nonlinear and stochastic optimization are also included. The Pyomo software provides familiar modeling features within Python, a powerful dynamic programming language that has a very clear, readable syntax and intuitive object orientation. Pyomo includes Python classes for defining sparse sets, parameters, and variables, which can be used to formulate algebraic expressions that define objectives and constraints. Moreover, Pyomo can be used from a command-line interface and within Python's interactive command environment, which makes it easy to create Pyomo models, apply a variety of optimizers, and examine solutions. The software supports a different modeling approach than commercial AML (Algebraic Modeling Languages) tools, and is designed for flexibility, extensibility, portability, and maintainability but also maintains the central ideas in modern AMLs.},

Four main types of redox flow batteries employing zinc electrodes are considered: zinc-bromine, zinc-cerium, zinc-air and zinc-nickel. Problems associated with zinc deposition and dissolution, especially in acid media, are summarized. The main features of each battery are identified and the benefits of a flowing electrolyte are explained. In each case, a summary of their development, the electrode and cell reactions, their potentials, the performance of the positive and negative electrodes, the advantages of a single flow compartment and cell developments for energy storage are included.

  abstract  = {The utilization of grid-scale energy storage is growing exponentially due its decreasing costs and added flexibility to providing numerous services. Among the currently available storage systems, batteries based on lithium-ion chemistries are poised to provide a significant share of such flexibility due to their high power and energy density, and relatively low cost per unit energy. However, research on such systems has been segregated into focus on its chemical properties, and focus on the grid integration separately. This paper proposes a data-driven framework to characterize battery energy storage systems embedded into a decision-making optimization model. The model embeds two mechanisms, variable C-rates and variable efficiencies, so that batteries may be scheduled at high-power (high C-rate) operations to capture additional grid revenues, only if economical against the cost of degradation effects. The framework is applied to stationary battery energy storage systems in retail markets in order to explore the improved energy arbitrage benefits.},

And then, a mathematical framework for optimal allocation of VRB ESS was proposed considering the maximum consumption of wind and solar energy, the total costs of VRB ESS and the total benefits of VRB ESS. This proposed mathematical framework was solved by a dynamic programming optimisation algorithm and has been applied to determine the optimal VRB power and energy ratings in a real distribution power system.

  abstract      = {We have demonstrated the performance of an aqueous redox flow battery composed of a negative electrode consisting of a redox couple between anthraquinone di-sulfonate and its corresponding hydroquinone, and a positive electrode consisting of a redox couple between hydrobromic acid and bromine. The peak power density is approximately 0.6 W/cm 2 . After 750 deep cycles, the average discharge capacity retention is 99.84{\%} per cycle and the average current efficiency is 98.35{\%}. The greatest technical hurdle to us getting most of our electricity from sunshine and wind is their intermittency. We recently published initial results on the performance of a quinone-bromide flow battery that appears particularly well suited to cost-effective storage of large amounts of electrical energy, e.g. from intermittent renewables (1). The negative electrolyte in the discharged state is composed of 100 ml of an aqueous solution of 1 M 9,10-anthraquinone-2,7-disulphonic acid (AQDS) and 1 M H 2 SO 4 . The positive electrolyte in the discharged state is composed 120 ml of an aqueous solution of 3 M HBr and 0.5 M Br 2 . As described in Reference (1), six sheets of pre-treated Toray carbon paper, with no added catalyst, were used on either side of a Nafion 212 (50 um) membrane, using interdigitated flow fields. A schematic of the cell is shown in Figure 1. During charging, the quinone undergoes a rapid, reversible two-electron two-proton reduction to the corresponding hydroquinone, AQDSH 2 , and the bromide on the positive electrode is oxidized to bromine, accompanied by the migration of protons from posolyte to negolyte. During discharging, these reactions are reversed. Polarization curves for several states of charge (SOC), reported in Reference (1), are reproduced in Figure 2. We take SOC to mean the quinone state of charge, i.e. the percentage of the organic molecules that are in the reduced form. The inset shows that the open-circuit potential varies approximately linearly with SOC and is about 0.80 V at 50{\%} SOC and about 0.94 V at 100{\%} SOC. These results imply a peak power density of about 0.6 V at 90{\%} SOC (1).},

The developed prototype VRFB system is capable of delivering more than 1.1 kW in the operation range of 15-85{\%} state of charge (SOC) at 80 mA cm-2with an energy efficiency of 82{\%} and energy content of 1.4 kWh. The system operated stably without any precipitation at electrolyte temperatures {\textgreater}45 °C. At similar electrolyte temperatures, tests with a conventional sulfuric acid electrolyte suffered from precipitation after 80 cycles. By operating stably at elevated temperatures ({\textgreater}40 °C), the mixed acid system enables significant advantages over the conventional sulfate system, namely; 1) high stack energy efficiency due to better kinetics and lower electrolyte resistance, 2) lower viscosity resulting in reduced pumping losses, 3) lower capital cost by elimination of heat exchanger, 4) higher system efficiency and 5) simplified system design and operation.

abstract = {In this work, we conceived and fabricated a three-electrode electrochemical cell and transparent vanadium redox flow battery to in-situ investigate the hydrogen evolution reaction during battery operation. Experimental results show that operating temperature has a strong influence on the HER rate. In particular, compared with V3+reduction reaction, HER is more sensitive to temperature variation. It is also found that, contrary to the conventional wisdom that side reactions occur at the late stage of the charge process, H2evolves at a relatively low SOC. About 0.26 and 1.94 mL H2were collected at an early (SOC lower than 20{\%}) and end of the charge process, respectively, suggesting that attention to the hydrogen formation at the negative electrode in the early charge process should also be paid to during long-term battery operations. Moreover, the produced hydrogen gas at the negative side prefers to form macroscopically observable bubbles onto the electrode surface, covering the active sites for vanadium redox reactions, while oxygen evolution (including CO2production) at the positive side corrodes electrode surface and introduces certain oxygen-containing functional groups.},

It was found that the V5+species exist as hydrated penta co-ordinated vanadate ion, i.e. [VO2(H2O)3]1+. This hydrated structure is not stable at elevated temperature and change into neutral H3VO4molecule via a deprotonation process and subsequently leading to the observed V2O5precipitation in V5+electrolyte solutions. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Rahman2009,
abstract = {The vanadium redox battery (VRB) employs two "electrolyte tanks" that store energy in the form of the two vanadium redox couples and a cell "stack" where the charge/discharge reactions occur. To date, 2 M vanadium electrolyte have been successfully used in large demonstration projects for stationary applications. For mobile applications however, higher vanadium concentrations are required to reduce the size and weight of the battery. The main limitation for the vanadium electrolyte concentration and subsequently its energy density in the VRB is the thermal precipitation of the V(V) ion at elevated temperatures. In this paper optimization study of vanadium V(V) supersaturated solutions in terms of concentrations, temperature, and precipitation behavior are reported along with properties such as density and viscosity. It appears that 3.0-3.5 M V(V) solutions in 6 M total sulfate are sufficiently stable at temperatures up to 30 °C, although 2 M solutions are still required for operation at higher temperatures of about 40 °C. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Li2011,
abstract = {The all-vanadium redox flow battery is a promising technology for large-scale renewable and grid energy storage, but is limited by the low energy density and poor stability of the vanadium electrolyte solutions. A new vanadium redox flow battery with a significant improvement over the current technology is reported in this paper. This battery uses sulfate-chloride mixed electrolytes, which are capable of dissolving 2.5 M vanadium, representing about a 70{\%} increase in energy capacity over the current sulfate system. More importantly, the new electrolyte remains stable over a wide temperature range of -5 to 50 C, potentially eliminating the need for electrolyte temperature control in practical applications. This development would lead to a significant reduction in the cost of energy storage, thus accelerating its market penetration.},
